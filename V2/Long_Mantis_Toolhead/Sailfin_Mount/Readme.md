This is a mod to allow for mounting of Sailfin extruder on a regular Mantis toolhead.

## Prints needed
- modified carriage
- modified strain relief

## Streamlined instructions
- follow instructions on Mantis repo, just replace standard carriage with *sailfin_compatible_carriage*.
- secure sailfin extruder to toolhead and the new strain relief.

## Notes
- this carriage (and the Sailfin extruder) are fully compatible with the *sensorized_hotend_mount*. 
The only change in this case is  to cut flush bowden piece at the extruder exit. leave a bit of extra otherwise.
