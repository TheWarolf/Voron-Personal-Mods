This is a mod to allow for mounting of Sailfin extruder on a regular Mantis toolhead. **(Repo is WIP)**

## Prints needed
- *sailfin_carriage.stl*
- *sailfin_strain_relief_threaded.stl* or *sailfin_strain_relief_smooth.stl*

## Streamlined instructions
- follow instructions on Mantis repo, just replace standard carriage with *sailfin_carriage.stl*.
- secure sailfin extruder to toolhead and bolt the new strain relief.

## Notes
- this carriage (and the Sailfin extruder) are fully compatible with the *sensorized_hotend_mount*. 
The only change in this case is  to cut flush bowden piece at the extruder exit. leave a bit of extra otherwise.
