This is a mod to allow for mounting of Sailfin extruder on a regular Mantis toolhead. 
Again, all the credit for the awesome design of the sailfin extruder goes to its creator, link to [original repo here](https://github.com/CroXY3D/Sailfin-Extruder).

## Prints needed
- *Carriage.stl*
- *StrainRelief_Threaded.stl* 
## Optional prints
If you want to use the mod for MM capabilities, a bowden retainer is needed.
Print also the following to substitute the original pieces 
- *Sailfin_Body_ECAS.stl*
- *Sailfin_Guidler_ECAS.stl*


## Streamlined instructions
- follow instructions on Mantis repo, just replace standard carriage with *carriage.stl*.
- secure sailfin extruder to toolhead and bolt the new strain relief.

## Notes
- this carriage (and the Sailfin extruder) are fully compatible with the *sensorized_hotend_mount*. 
The only change in this case is  to cut flush bowden piece at the extruder exit. leave a bit of extra otherwise.
